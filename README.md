🛡️ MindShield: Professional Reputation Guardian
MindShield is an AI-driven safety net for social media, built for the Microsoft Innovation Studio Hackathon. 
It acts as an intelligent "pause button" to ensure your digital footprint always reflects your best professional self.

aggressive, or overly intense content before it goes live.

AI Sentiment Check: Uses Microsoft Semantic Kernel and Ollama to analyze drafts for tone and professional risk.

Guardian Alert: Automatically notifies a trusted contact if a post is flagged as high-risk, providing an extra layer of accountability.

Modern Dashboard: A fast, responsive interface built with the latest .NET 10 features.
